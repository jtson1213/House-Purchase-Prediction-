# Home Purchase Prediction
Coursework Project for CSC424 (Advanced Data Analysis)

# Introduction:

Every year, millions of homes are sold across the United States adding up to several trillions of dollars in transactions. Thousands of companies have built their business on taking a piece of this pie. These same companies are continuously looking for ways to beat out their competition by spending millions of dollars each year on marketing and buying leads. If there was a predictive model created to better understand who is in the market to purchase a home, that predictive model would be worth millions of dollars. 

With that in mind, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship of consumer demographics along with the consumer’s home data in order to predict if they are in the market to purchase a home.   

•	Conducted data preprocessing to transform the original data into an understandable format.

•	Built logistic regression models based on PCA scores.

•	Achieved 62.15% of prediction accuracy through cross-validation test.
